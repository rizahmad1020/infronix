      <h3 class="policy-heading">REFUNDS & RETURNS</h3>
      <p class="policy-text">
        INFRONIX TECH aims to provide our buyers with excellent assistance and to deliver them fair return services. 
        To assure our customers are satisfied with the product(s) they order, we offer a 30-days refund policy which includes the replacement.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="policy-block">
      <h3 class="policy-heading">ELECTRONIC DELIVERY PRODUCTS</h3>
      <p class="policy-text">
        Once a downloadable software product is delivered to your email, it is not returnable or refundable. 
        We understand that installing downloadable software can sometimes have difficulties. 
        In the circumstances where you are unable to install your software, we have technicians that will help you in getting your software installed. 
        Your order will be eligible for a refund only in the rare circumstance where our support technician is unable to install your software.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="policy-block">
      <h3 class="policy-subheading">Regarding Microsoft Product Keys:</h3>
      <p class="policy-text">
        Please be aware that once a product key is added to your Microsoft account it cannot be returned or refunded. 
        Once a product key has been registered to a Microsoft account it is forever tethered to that account and cannot be removed – 
        even if you haven’t downloaded the software or you made a mistake and ordered a Windows version instead of a Mac version or vice versa. 
        Once you add a product key to your Microsoft account, it is yours perpetually, and there is no way to un-assign it from your account, 
        therefore it cannot be returned or refunded.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ✅ New Section: Replacement Policy -->
    <div class="policy-block">
      <p class="policy-text"><strong>Please note:</strong> we will only issue a <strong>replacement</strong> on defective Product Keys and wrong version purchase</p>

      <p class="policy-text">
        Please ensure your replacement request does not meet any of the following restrictions before attempting a replacement request.
      </p>

      <ol class="policy-text">
        <li><strong>Incorrect purchases:</strong>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>We can issue a replacement if a customer has purchased an incorrect product and/or the product is not compatible. 
              We endeavour to make the product compatibility as clear and visible as possible, and we cannot be held responsible for any incorrect purchases.</li>
            <li><strong>example 1</strong>, purchases a windows software package for a Mac machine (we can issue replacement keys in some cases)</li>
            <li><strong>example 2</strong>, purchases a product suitable for windows 10 only, but has a windows 8 operating system. 
              (we can issue replacement keys in some cases)</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Installation and/or Activation Issues:</strong>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>Our support team are ready to help with any issues you have with your purchased Product Key, 
                therefore before actioning a refund, we endeavour to resolve any issues with you.</li>
            <li>We reserve the right to request digital images during this process, such as a screenshot of the code being entered and the error encountered 
                to help us investigate the issue.</li>
            <li>In some cases, we may need to use remote-based access and support software, such as Teamviewer, to resolve your issue.</li>
            <li>Refunds and/or replacements will only be issued in cases where we have been allowed access to fully investigate and are unsolvable.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Product Use Issues:</strong>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>For product-related issues, such as making a new document in Word, or a program not responding to issues, please contact Microsoft or view 
                documentation for software usage.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <!-- ✅ New Section Continued: Cancellation, Delivery & Issues -->
    <div class="policy-block">
      <ol class="policy-text" start="4">
        <li><strong>Order Cancellation:</strong>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>We reserve the right to cancel any incoming order that it might believe to be suspicious (such as unauthorised/fraudulent payments etc.). Similar paid orders are refunded and the goods are not delivered.</li>
            <li>We cannot cancel orders if you have already received the activation code, as this item is no longer safe and secure and there is no way to re-sell that item.</li>
            <li>We cannot cancel or refund an order, just because you don’t enjoy / like or use the product. Once you activate the code, it is permanently bound to your account, therefore we cannot refund you.</li>
            <li>Due to the nature of the product and Digital Delivery, once ordered the product key will be shown on the screen and emailed directly to you. As we are unable to stop this process and be unable to re-issue this unique Product Key, as soon as you have purchased your item this would become non-refundable and you would be unable to cancel your order.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Digital Delivery:</strong>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>As we offer digital products, we are unable to know the identity of the person who redeems the code. For each order placed, we track the delivery of the Product Key and store vital details of when the code has been viewed by the customer, including the date, time, and IP address. All of our Product Keys are guaranteed and checked.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Error Code Issues:</strong>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>Redemption errors must be reported within 7 days of purchase. We are unable to offer refunds and/or replacements once this date has passed.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Exchanges:</strong>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>If the software package is defective and/or cannot be resolved even after receiving assistance from our technical support team (Via Email/Live Chat), we will issue customers with a replacement product key for the same product purchased only.</li>
            <li>Please note that exchange keys are only available within 7 days of the original purchase date, therefore we advise you to redeem your product straight away</li>
          </ol>
